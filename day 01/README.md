<!--*** ==================================================  HOW THE INTERNET WORKS  ============================================================== ***-->


1. History of the Web
 Web 1.0 (1990s – early 2000s)
 In the early stage of the internet, websites were
static. They only contained fixed information, and
users could only read the content without
interacting.
 Example
 Early news websites or company information pages.
 Web 2.0 (2004 onwards)
 This era introduced user-generated content and
social interaction. People could not only consume
but also create, share, and connect with others
online.
 Rise of platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia,
and Blogs.
 Main focus: Community building, sharing, and
collaboration.
 Web 3.0 (Now & Future)
 The modern and future web is built on blockchain
technology and decentralization. Data is no longer
stored in a single company’s server but distributed
across many computers.
 Users own their data and can also earn via tokens, NFTs,
and smart contracts.
 Examples: Cryptocurrencies, decentralized apps (dApps),
and Metaverse projects.

How Computers Communicate
 Every computer that connects to the internet has an
IP Address, which acts like its phone number. To
communicate, computers follow specific rules
known as protocols.
 TC P/IP protocol is the foundation of the internet.
 Data is broken into small chunks called packets.
 Packets travel via cables, WiFi, or satellites.
 When they reach the destination, they are reassembled
like pieces of a puzzle.
 How Data Travels Across the World
 The journey of data involves several key components:
 Routers:
 Switches:
Undersea cables:
 Work like traffic police, deciding the route of
data packets.
 Connect devices inside a local network (e.g.,
your home WiFi).
 Huge fiber optic cables that connect
different countries and continents.
 Example
 A WhatsApp message sent from India to the USA
moves through fiber optic undersea cables. If one
route fails, the internet automatically finds an
alternate path.

4. Domain Name, IP & MAC Address, Routing
 Domain Name
 A human-friendly way to access websites (e.g.,
google.com, amazon.in) instead of remembering
numbers.
 IP Address (Internet Protocol)
 The numeric identity of a device or server (e.g.,
142.250.77.206).
 Works like a phone number of your device on the
internet.
 MAC Address (Media Access Control)
 A unique hardware ID given to every network card
of a device.
 Works like an Aadhaar card for your device —
permanent and unique.
 Routing
 Routers analyze the network and decide the fastest
and safest path for data packets to travel across the
internet.
 5. ISP & DNS Working Together
 ISP (Internet Service Provider)
 Companies like Jio, Airtel, or BSNL that provide you
with internet access. They connect your device to
the global internet.

DNS (Domain Name System)
 DNS works like the phonebook of the internet. It
translates domain names into IP addresses so that
computers can understand them.
 Process Example:
 You type google.com in the browser.
 DNS translates it into its IP → 142.250.77.206.
 Your ISP uses this IP to connect you to Google’s server.
 Without DNS, we would have to remember long IP
numbers for every single website

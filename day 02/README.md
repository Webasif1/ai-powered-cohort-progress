/// Client-Server Architecture
1. What is Client-Server Model
2. Difference Between Client and Server
The client-server model is the foundation of how the internet works.
You (client) request google.com in your browser → Google’s server
responds with the webpage.
 Example
 Client (Browser)
A Client is a device or program (like a browser or mobile app) that
requests data or services.

A Server is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers the
requested data to clients.

Relationship: Client asks → Server responds.
Runs on the user’s device (laptop, phone).

Sends requests for resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or images.

Displays the fetched content to the user.
 Server
A more powerful computer that stores websites, applications, or
databases.

Listens for incoming requests and responds accordingly.

Stays always online and connected to ensure availability.

3. HTTP Request-Response Cycle
4. What Happens When You Visit a Website
The communication between client and server happens in a cycle
known as the HTTP request-response cycle.
 This entire cycle usually takes place within milliseconds.
User Action → You type a URL or click a link.

Browser sends an HTTP request to the server.

Server processes the request (fetch data, execute logic, access
database).

Server sends an HTTP response back (HTML, JSON, images, or files).

Browser renders the page and shows it to the user.
You type www.example.com in your browser.

Browser contacts the DNS to get the IP address of the website.

Browser connects to the correct server via your ISP (Internet Service
Provider).

Browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request.

Server locates the requested page or data and sends it back.

Browser displays the website to you.

5. Frontend vs Backend
Client-Server Architecture
 Frontend (Client-Side)
The visible part of a website or application.

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Focuses on UI/UX (buttons, forms, visuals, design).

 Example: The login form you see on your scre

Backend (Server-Side)
The hidden part of the system that runs on the server.

Handles logic, authentication, database operations, APIs.

 Example: Checking whether your login credentials are correct.
6. Static vs Dynamic Websites
 Static Website
Shows the same content to everyone.

Built with pre-written HTML files.

Very fast but limited in interactivity.

 Example: Portfolio sites, simple company info pages.
 Dynamic Website
Content changes based on user input or data.

Built using backend logic + database integration.

 Example: Facebook’s news feed or Amazon’s product pages.
7. What is Web Hosting
Web hosting means renting space on a server to store your website
files so that they can be accessed online.
Hosting providers like Hostinger, A WS, GoDaddy keep your site running
and accessible 24/7.

Without hosting, your site cannot be seen on the internet.

 Types of Web Hosting
Shared Hosting:
VPS / Dedicated Hosting:
Cloud Hosting:
 Multiple websites share one server (cheapest, but slower).

 A server is divided or dedicated for one website
(more power, more cost).

 Scalable and flexible hosting (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud,
Microsoft Azure).

/// Understanding HTTP & HTTPS
1. What is HTTP and Its Different Versions
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of
communication between a client (browser) and a server. 
 It defines how requests are made by the client and how responses
are returned by the server.
 Different Versions of HTTP
Understanding HTTP & HTTPS
HTTP/1.0 (1996):

Every request opens a new connection.

Slower and inefficient because connections closed after each
response.

HTTP/1.1 (1997):

Introduced persistent connections (keep-alive).

Multiple requests could share the same connection.

Became the most widely used version for years.

HTTP/2 (2015):

Much faster; supports multiplexing (many requests in one
connection).

Uses binary protocol (instead of plain text), reducing delay.

Greatly improved performance.

HTTP/3 (2020s):

Built on QUIC protocol (runs on UDP).

Even faster and more reliable for modern apps like video streaming,
gaming, and real-time communication.

 2. HTTP Status Codes for Responses
Whenever a server responds, it sends back a status code to indicate
the result of the request.
 If you type a wrong link, you’ll often see 404 Not Found.
 Example :
3. What is HTTPS and Why It’s Better than HTTP
1xx – Informational: Request received, still processing.

2xx – Success: Request completed successfully.

200 OK: Standard success message.

3xx – Redirection: Further action needed.

301 Moved Permanently, 302 Found.

4xx – Client Errors: Problem with the client’s request.

400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found.

5xx – Server Errors: Issue with the server itself.

500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable.
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP.
It uses encryption to protect communication between browser and
server.

Prevents hackers from reading or modifying your data.

Always used in sensitive activities like banking, payments, and login
forms.

4. How HTTPS Provides a Secure Connection
5. What is SSL/TLS Encryption
6. What are Proxy and Reverse Proxy
HTTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure communication.
They ensure three key things:
Data is converted into unreadable form before sending.

Only the intended server and browser can decrypt it.

Protects against:

Eavesdropping (hackers listening to traffic).

Data tampering.

Identity theft.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are
security protocols.

TLS is the modern and more secure version of SSL.
Encryption → Outsiders cant read your data.

Authentication → Confirms the website is genuine.

Integrity → Data isnt modified during transfer.
Proxy Server
W orks between client and internet.

Hides the client s identity.

Uses:

Privacy (hide IP address).

Access blocked content.

Content filtering in schools/offices.
Reverse Proxy
Sits in front of servers and handles client requests on their behalf.

Clients don’t know the actual server details.

Uses:

Load balancing (distributing traffic).

Security (protecting actual servers).

Caching (faster performance).
7. How VPN Works and Helps Accessing Restricted Content
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure “tunnel” between
your device and the internet.
Encrypts all data → ISP or government cannot monitor browsing activity.

Hides your real location by showing a different IP address.

Useful for:

Accessing restricted websites/apps.

Ensuring privacy on public Wi-Fi.

Securing sensitive business or personal communication.
Using a VPN can make it appear like you’re browsing from the US, even
if you’re in India.

 — since you wanna wreck everything you’ve learned and test your JavaScript foundation
 hard, here’s a killer question set that’ll push your basics to the limit. It’s split by topic — perfect to see if
 you’re truly locked in

 🧠
 JS Core & Fundamentals
 1. What’s the difference between var, let, and const — and how does hoisting behave for each?
 2. Explain the difference between a statement and an expression with examples.
 3. Why is JavaScript called a loosely typed or dynamically typed language?
 4. What’s the difference between null, undefined, and NaN?
 5. What will this log and why:
 js
 console.log(typeof null);
 6. What’s the output?
 js
 let x = 10;
 console.log(x++ + ++x);
 7. What is the difference between == and ===?
 Give an example where == gives true but === gives false.
 💬
 Strings
 8. What does splice() do? (Careful—does it even exist for strings?)
 9. How would you extract "JS" from "I love JS" using slice()?
 10. Write one line that converts "asif" → "Asif".

11. What’s the difference between split() and join()?
 12. How would you check if a string contains “fire” without using regex?
 🔢
 Data Types
 13. What’s the difference between primitive and reference data types?
 14. Is an array primitive or reference?
 15. What happens when you copy an object like this:
 js
 const obj2 = obj1;
 16. Explain how you can clone an object without linking it to the original.
 ⚙
 Operators
 17. What’s the difference between ++x and x++?
 18. Explain this code:
 js
 let a = "10", b = 10;
 console.log(a == b, a === b);
 19. What does the && operator return if both conditions are true?
 20. Explain what’s wrong with this:
 js
 if (x = 5) { console.log("true") }
 🔁
 Conditionals & Loops
 21. Write a switch statement that logs the weekday based on a number (1–7).
 22. What’s the difference between while and do...while?
 23. When would you use break vs continue?
 24. Write a for loop that prints only even numbers between 1 and 20.
 25. Write a for...of loop and a for...in loop — what’s the difference?
 🧩
 Functions
 26. What’s the difference between parameters and arguments?

 28. Explain what an IIFE is and why it’s useful.
 29. What’s the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
 30. What’s the output?
 js
 console.log(a);
 var a = 10;
 31. What’s the output?
 js
 console.log(b);
 let b = 10;
 32. Explain closure in your own words and show a simple code example.
 33. What’s the difference between a pure and an impure function?
 34. How does this behave differently in arrow functions?
 🧱
 Arrays & Objects
 35. What’s the difference between map() and forEach()?

 38. What’s the difference between push() and unshift()?
 39. Write code to reverse an array without using .reverse().
 40. Explain what happens here:
 js
 const arr = [1, 2];
 arr[2] = arr;
 console.log(arr);
 41. What does Object.freeze() do?
 42. What’s the difference between Object.seal() and Object.freeze()?
 43. How do you access a nested object property safely (without erroring if undefined)?
 44. Explain what this refers to in an object method.
 ⏰

 " after 3 seconds.
 🧠
 Bonus: Trick Questions
 48. What’s the output?
